# 📞 Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) Decoder using MT8870

This project demonstrates a DTMF-based home automation system that allows users to control appliances remotely using tones generated by a mobile phone keypad. The system uses the MT8870 DTMF Decoder IC to decode tone signals and trigger corresponding outputs — such as LEDs or relays — making it ideal for low-cost automation.
